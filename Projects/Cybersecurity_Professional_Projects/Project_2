# Project 2: Ransomware Attack Response

## Description:
This project involves responding to a ransomware attack. We created a scenario and analyzed the response using analysis and recovery tools.

## Steps:
1. **Detecting the Attack**: We identified the ransomware through indicators from the SIEM logs.
2. **Recovery**: We took actions to remove the malicious software and restore data from backups.
3. **Security Measures**: We proposed strategies to prevent future attacks, such as enhancing endpoint security and user education.

## Tools:
- SIEM (e.g., Splunk)
- Backup & Recovery Tools
