# Room: Cybersecurity 101 (TryHackMe)

##  Cybersecurity Principles

- **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**: These are the three foundational principles of cybersecurity.
    - **Confidentiality**: Ensures that data is accessible only to authorized individuals.
    - **Integrity**: Ensures that data remains unaltered and accurate.
    - **Availability**: Ensures that data is available when needed.
  
- **Network Protection**: Techniques like firewalls, VPNs, and IDS are used to protect data within a network.

##  Risk Management

- We use various methods to identify risks, including:
  - **Qualitative Risk Assessment**: Uses scales (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to evaluate risks.
  - **Quantitative Risk Assessment**: Quantifies risks with numerical data.
